        <h4>1. Always follow appliance instructions for improved electrical safety.</h4>
        <p>
        "Read the instructions" should top the list of electrical safety tips at home. Understanding home appliance safety improves both the performance of your device and your personal safety. Should any appliance give you even a slight electrical shock, stop using it until a qualified electrician checks it for problems.

        <h4>2. Watch out for overloaded outlets to protect your home.</h4>
        <p>
        Overloading an electrical outlet is a common cause of electrical problems. Check all outlets to ensure they are cool to the touch, have protective faceplates and are in proper working order. According to ESFI, you can follow these electrical outlet safety tips:

        <h4>3. Replace or repair damaged electrical cords to keep your home safe.</h4>
        <p>
        Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution. All power and extension cords should be checked regularly for signs of fraying and cracking, and they should then be repaired or replaced as needed. Power cords should not be stapled into place or run under rugs and furniture. Cords under rugs pose a tripping hazard and can overheat, while furniture can crush cord insulation and damage wires.

        <h4>4. Keep your used and unused cords tidy and secure to prevent damage.</h4>
        <p>
        Electrical safety tips don’t just apply to power cords when they’re in use—cords also need to be stored safely to prevent damage. Keep stored cords away from children and pets (who may chew on or play with the cords). Try to avoid wrapping cords tightly around objects; this can stretch the cord or cause overheating. Never rest a cord on a hot surface in order to prevent damage to the cord’s insulation and wires.
         </p>
        <h4>5. Unplug all your unused appliances to reduce potential risks.</h4>
        <p>
        One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from
